Ms. Klems,

I'd like to apologize for holding off so long on these programs.
It's been a very rough last month of the semester for me, as I have been in
and out of remission with my disease. I know that it must be hard grading so many computer programs,
because they start to get old quick. I just want to really apologize for having so many to turn in, it's just
been hard getting them all done because I've had so much other coursework in other classes to follow up on as well.
I hope that you will still accept these, because I really look forward to learning more about Java in your next course, because
you made it a very interesting subject. Thank you so much for your time, and understanding this semester, I really appreciate it.

Sincerely,
Sean Coady
